Using OSliderView

You can integrate the slider into your view like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var sliderValue: Float = 0.5
    @State private var bufferValue: Float = 0.7
    @State private var isAnimating: Bool = false
    @State private var hideThumb: Bool = false
    @State private var sliderHeight: CGFloat = 7

    var body: some View {
        OSliderView(
            value: $sliderValue,
            bufferValue: $bufferValue,
            isAnimating: $isAnimating,
            hideThumb: $hideThumb,
            lineHeight: sliderHeight,
            bufferProgressColor: Color.gray.opacity(0.3)
        )
    }
}
```

Parameters
